Extinction Curves
-----------------

External packages used include `dust_extintion`, `measure_extinction`, and
`extstar_data`.  The basic information on each star is given in `extstar_data`
including the FUSE/IUE/STIS spectra.  `dust_extinction` provides the
fitting curves shapes (FM90, AxAvToExv).  `measure_extinction` gives the routines
to read the data and calculate extinction curves.

Curves calculated with `run_all_ext`.
